1;4;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;I see a series of items set up in a chain reaction. The mouse will run in the wheel that will make the boot hit the switch, which will turn on the saw which will cut the rope and fire the arrow.

1;6;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;There is a balloon floating with a weight attached to the bottom of it. Underneath the balloon is a launching pad which has a rocket on it. To the left of the balloon there is a contraption that consists of a wheel with a foot outside it and with a mouse inside that is running and turning the wheel to generate movement. This causes the foot to press a switch that has a cable leading to a saw. The saw is poised over and a wooden stand that is holding a loaded bow and arrow pointing at the balloon. The arrow will fire and hit the balloon which will then cause the weight to fall onto the launchpad and fire the rocket into the air.;3;correct;75;2: female;NA
1;7;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;There is a hamster in a wheel,  whilst running the shoe moves and kicks the switch to start the saw, which cut the rope to the bow, the arrow on the bow releases and shoots the balloon, which causes the weight to drop very quickly. The weight hits the board at a hard and strong pace on the let which causes the rocket on the right hand side to jump in the air. ;3;correct;37;1: male;NA

1;9;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;The mouse is spinning the wheel that will kick the boot. This will hit the switch to turn on the chainsaw. This will cut the string holding back the bow, so it releases an arrow. The arrow will fly through tha air, popping the balloon. This will make the weight drop onto the seesaw, so the rocket on the other side is propelled into the air.;3;correct;51;2: female;NA
1;10;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;I see a wheel with a mouse inside of it, that has a boot attached on the bottom left quadrant of the wheel. The boot is raised on it's heel pointing towards what appears to be a switch that is connected to the end of a chainsaw, that's also hung up on a nail. The chainsaw is pointed towards a machine that is hooked up to a crossbow, that's pointing at a balloon which is weighted down. Below that balloon is a floor being balanced by something that has a rocket ship on it.;3;correct;67;2: female;No issues at all.

2) A shelf with a bow and arrow attached to the right of it. A rocket sits below the shelf, with the suggestion that the rocket will fire and trigger the arrow.
3) The arrow mentioned in 2) is pointing towards a small shelf which is mounted on a circular wheel or pin. This is below a small wheel with eight spokes that has a mouse in the middle of it. The wheel has a small ""leg"" attached to it. From the position of the small shelf and the ""leg"", the suggestion is that the small shelf will rotate, hitting the leg, and turning the wheel.

2;13;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;dysfunctional;img/dysfunctional_machine.png;I see a saw connected to a wall and being hung on the wall. A hamster in a wheel running and a foot coming out of the bottom, seeming to imply the hamster keeps it in that position? There is a balloon that is strong enough to hold up a weight. Then there is a strange contraption which looks like a device that is like a bow and arrow, and it is not at all obvious what it is or what it does, or why a rocket is under it.;3;correct;37;1: male;NA
2;14;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;dysfunctional;img/dysfunctional_machine.png;A series of whimsical contraptions with an unclear purpose. It reminds me of a sequence - the weighted balloon knocking into the rocket, which fires upwards towards the crossbow - which loosens it's arrow, hitting the mouse wheel, which rolls forward into the electric saw. The mouse would not have a happy ending.;3;correct;38;1: male;None.

1;20;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;I see a balloon that is tied into a bow at the bottom on the right side, but not all the way to the right, it is still close to the center and it is being held down by a weight. On the left side of the balloon there is an arrow technology machine that is facing slightly upwards with the arrow towards the balloon. The balloon also has a glossy mark on the upper right side to show its roundness. The arrow machine looks like it is from the 19th century and appears to have a wooden bottom and a loophole that comes out of stick in the center that holds the arrow. The arrow looks like it has a face with two eyes but might just be the design. On the left side of the machine is this saw or electric gadget that is being held by a string that is slung over a nail. A wire is connected to the saw bulldozer machine and is curling until it reaches what appears to be an outlet. It looks permanently attached to the outlet. On the left side of the outlet and bottom part of the wire is a wheel with a mouse inside and a shoe connected to its bottom left corner. There is also a sea saw looking image that is not tilted with a wood piece balancing on a small tire wheel with a rocket on the right side.;3;correct;27;2: female;Thank you there were no issues.
1;21;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;img/functional_machine.png;The hamster will turn the wheel.  This will make the leg flick the switch.  The switch will power the chainsaw which in turn will saw through the rope.  This will release the arrow which will burst the balloon.

To the right of this, there is a small rocket under a platform or shelf possibly supporting a crossbow with an arrow in it. A little higher up and to the right of that, there's a rodent in a hamster wheel over a board on a small wheel and farther to the right and a bit lower, level with the crossbow, there's a nail, hanging from which there is a chainsaw or electric knife with a twisted cord attached to a small box of some kind, which is the lowest object on the picture. All is in black and grey on a white background, and the pictures are more like diagrams than drawings - simplified and mostly outlines. The lower part of the rocket fins seems to be missing.
