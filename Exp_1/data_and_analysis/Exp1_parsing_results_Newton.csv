1; separate_parts ; Hot air balloon tied to a string, Spoked wheel, magnifying glass, dart, a bow with a arrow nocked, mouse, boot, and a weight tied with string and what looks to be a chainsaw ;33;  ;0
2; separate_parts ; I see a wheel, I see a see-saw, a boot, a rocket, a mouse, what looks to be an electric saw plugged in to an outlet, a balloon with a string attached, and a bow and arrow with a rope attached. I am not 100% sure what the drawing in the bottom left corner is, but I want to say it is a kettlebell with a rope attached.  ;68;  ;0
3; dysfunctional ; I can see a balloon with a weight on it, a bow and arrow with a rocket underneath it, which is firing an arrow at a hamster in a wheel. I can then see a chain saw, which is nailed onto the wall and plugged in for electricity.  ;48;  ;0
4; functional ; I see a series of items set up in a chain reaction. The mouse will run in the wheel that will make the boot hit the switch, which will turn on the saw which will cut the rope and fire the arrow. The arrow will pop the balloon and the weight will fall hitting the see saw and firing the rocket upwards. ;62;  ;0
5; separate_parts ; I see a balloon, a mouse, a boot, a rocket, a wheel, a weight, a spear gun, a electric saw and what looks like a moving aid with a board on a wheel. ;33;  ;0
6; functional ; There is a balloon floating with a weight attached to the bottom of it. Underneath the balloon is a launching pad which has a rocket on it. To the left of the balloon there is a contraption that consists of a wheel with a foot outside it and with a mouse inside that is running and turning the wheel to generate movement. This causes the foot to press a switch that has a cable leading to a saw. The saw is poised over and a wooden stand that is holding a loaded bow and arrow pointing at the balloon. The arrow will fire and hit the balloon which will then cause the weight to fall onto the launchpad and fire the rocket into the air. ;125;  ;0
7; functional ; There is a hamster in a wheel,  whilst running the shoe moves and kicks the switch to start the saw, which cut the rope to the bow, the arrow on the bow releases and shoots the balloon, which causes the weight to drop very quickly. The weight hits the board at a hard and strong pace on the let which causes the rocket on the right hand side to jump in the air.  ;73;  ;0
8; separate_parts ; In the picture there are various line draw pictures ayed out at random. At the top there is a crossboe. To the left of it there is a ballon on a string anf to the right there is an electric meat carver that is plugged in. Underneath there is another row of pictures that include a wheel from a bike, a weight on a rope, a little boot, a seesaw a rocket and a hamster. ;75;  ;0
9; functional ; The mouse is spinning the wheel that will kick the boot. This will hit the switch to turn on the chainsaw. This will cut the string holding back the bow, so it releases an arrow. The arrow will fly through tha air, popping the balloon. This will make the weight drop onto the seesaw, so the rocket on the other side is propelled into the air. ;66;  ;0
10; functional ; I see a wheel with a mouse inside of it, that has a boot attached on the bottom left quadrant of the wheel. The boot is raised on it's heel pointing towards what appears to be a switch that is connected to the end of a chainsaw, that's also hung up on a nail. The chainsaw is pointed towards a machine that is hooked up to a crossbow, that's pointing at a balloon which is weighted down. Below that balloon is a floor being balanced by something that has a rocket ship on it. ;94;  ;0
11; dysfunctional ;" The machine appears to consist of four sections. As detailed from left to right, these appear as follows:_x000D_ _x000D_ 1) A balloon with a small black weight tied to the bottom of it with a string._x000D_ 2) A shelf with a bow and arrow attached to the right of it. A rocket sits below the shelf, with the suggestion that the rocket will fire and trigger the arrow._x000D_ 3) The arrow mentioned in 2) is pointing towards a small shelf which is mounted on a circular wheel or pin. This is below a small wheel with eight spokes that has a mouse in the middle of it. The wheel has a small ""leg"" attached to it. From the position of the small shelf and the ""leg"", the suggestion is that the small shelf will rotate, hitting the leg, and turning the wheel._x000D_ 4) An electric breadknife is plugged in to a wall socket and is suspended from the wall with a string which hangs over a nail. ";167;  ;0
12; dysfunctional ; A series of drawings depicting home alone sytle contraptions that seem to react with one another for an end result ;20;  ;0
13; dysfunctional ; I see a saw connected to a wall and being hung on the wall. A hamster in a wheel running and a foot coming out of the bottom, seeming to imply the hamster keeps it in that position? There is a balloon that is strong enough to hold up a weight. Then there is a strange contraption which looks like a device that is like a bow and arrow, and it is not at all obvious what it is or what it does, or why a rocket is under it. ;90; position ;1
14; dysfunctional ; A series of whimsical contraptions with an unclear purpose. It reminds me of a sequence - the weighted balloon knocking into the rocket, which fires upwards towards the crossbow - which loosens it's arrow, hitting the mouse wheel, which rolls forward into the electric saw. The mouse would not have a happy ending. ;53;  ;0
15; separate_parts ; I see what looks like an apparatus that comprises a wheel, an arrow with bow, an electronic saw with a cord, a lever, a boot, a bar that is attached to a hook, a balloon, a dart facing upward and a mouse. It seems like the mechanism is structured in a manner that the mouse would propel the arrow to hit the balloon, if certain actions are taken. ;68;  ;0
16; dysfunctional ; i see a weighted operated bow and arrow ;8;  ;0
17; separate_parts ; The drawing is a collection of small simple drawings in black on a white back ground. From left to right I see a weight hanging from a string, a thin bicycle wheel or similar, a boot, a shelf of some kind with only a middle round support, a balloon with a string under, a crossbow that appears mounted, a toy rocket, a hedge trimmer plugged into a socket and a mouse with no tail. ;74;  ;0
18; dysfunctional ; I see various objects. A toy rocket, a balloon with a weight attached to keep it from flying away, a bow and arrow, a hamster on a wheel and an electric saw.  ;32;  ;0
19; dysfunctional ; I see what looks like inventions. I see a rocket. I see a mouse on a wheel. A balloon attach to something.  ;22;  ;0
20; functional ; I see a balloon that is tied into a bow at the bottom on the right side, but not all the way to the right, it is still close to the center and it is being held down by a weight. On the left side of the balloon there is an arrow technology machine that is facing slightly upwards with the arrow towards the balloon. The balloon also has a glossy mark on the upper right side to show its roundness. The arrow machine looks like it is from the 19th century and appears to have a wooden bottom and a loophole that comes out of stick in the center that holds the arrow. The arrow looks like it has a face with two eyes but might just be the design. On the left side of the machine is this saw or electric gadget that is being held by a string that is slung over a nail. A wire is connected to the saw bulldozer machine and is curling until it reaches what appears to be an outlet. It looks permanently attached to the outlet. On the left side of the outlet and bottom part of the wire is a wheel with a mouse inside and a shoe connected to its bottom left corner. There is also a sea saw looking image that is not tilted with a wood piece balancing on a small tire wheel with a rocket on the right side. ;243;  ;0
21; functional ; The hamster will turn the wheel.  This will make the leg flick the switch.  The switch will power the chainsaw which in turn will saw through the rope.  This will release the arrow which will burst the balloon.  This will make the weight drop to the trolley which will then shoot the rocket into the air. ;56;  ;0
22; functional ; I believe it's called a rube goldberg machine where multiple actions are set off in a chain. _x000D_ . It starts with a mouse which spins the wheel as it runs._x000D_ . A boot is attached to said wheel and kicks a switch._x000D_ . The switch turns on an electric carving knife which cuts a string/rope._x000D_ . This string/rope is holding back a taut crossbow string._x000D_ . The crossbow fires into a balloon attached to a weight._x000D_ . As the balloon pops the weight drops onto a seesaw with a dart on one end._x000D_ . As the weight falls onto the see saw the dart on the other end is launched upwards. _x000D_ _x000D_ The drawing is in black and white.  ;121;  ;0
23; dysfunctional ;" On the far left I can see a balloon attached to a weight; right of the balloon I can see a crossbow attached to a platform, underneath which is some kind of rocket or missile. To the right of these objects I can see, at the top, a hamster/animal in a wheel, under which is a wheeled platform. Beneath this I can see an electronic carving knife hanging from a nail and plugged into an electrical socket. ";77;  ;0
24; separate_parts ; A weight tied onto a rope, likely from a heavy demolition machine. A bicycle wheel, possibly with or without a tyre. A boot. A balance board. A balloon with a string tied to it. A crossbow sitting on a stand, it is loaded with an arrow. Something that looks like a hedge trimmer wired to a light switch. A mouse, or rat depending on size.   ;65;  ;0
25; dysfunctional ; It looks like part of a 'mad professor' zany invention involving a crossbow, a rocket, a weighted balloon, an electric knife and a hamster wheel.  It almost looks a bit like the game Mousetrap.   ;34;  ;0
26; functional ; I see a mouse turning a wheel, that moves a boot to hit a button. This turns on a chainsaw to cut a rope that triggers a bow and arrow to fire. A balloon will be hit and this has a weight on that means when popped, the weight twill fall down to a balanced plank of wood. There's a rocket on the other side that will fire up ;69;  ;0
27; functional ; I see a number of different devices and mechanisms which are interconnected and if triggered will lead to a rocket shaped object being propelled into the air._x000D_ _x000D_ More specificaly, the drawing depicts a chain reaction with a mouse in a wheel which would make an attached boot hit a switch, triggered an electric saw to cut a cable and release an arrow.  This then pops a weight ballon which drops onto one side of a plank, when the weight drops the other end of the plank has a rocket shaped object which is propelled into the air. ;98;  ;0
28; functional ; I see a rat running on a hamster wheel to generate electricity that powers an electric knife. The knife is then poised to cut though the string of a bow, which in turn is holding an arrow. When the string is cut, the arrow will be propelled to burst a balloon which will, in turn, drop a weight onto a see-saw and propel a rocket up in the air. ;69;  ;0
29; separate_parts ; I see the basic elements and some of the potential layout of a typical Rube Goldberg machine, similar to the board game mouse trap. ;24;  ;0
30; functional ; Mouse on wheel flips switch that turns on saw that cuts string to release arrow that pops balloon which falls and sets off rocket ;24;  ;0
31; separate_parts ; I see the following items in the drawing, a weight, boot, seesaw,  wheel, balloon rocket, mouse and electric bread cutting knife and an object that resembles a bow of some description which I'm unsure of what the name of this object is. All of the these object appear in random distribution on the page and with no real relationship with each other. They are an odd bunch of objects to be grouped together. ;73;  ;0
32; separate_parts ; a wheel, a boot, balloon with a string attached, crossbow, chainsaw plugged to electricity, rocket, mouse, weight ;17;  ;0
33; dysfunctional ;" There is an electric chainsaw; a weighted hydrogen balloon; a crossbow suspended above a mini rocket and a rat in a wheel with a leg attached to it that moves a seesaw on wheels. ";34;  ;0
34; functional ;" This drawing shows a series of random mechanisms whose momentum will ultimately cause a toy rocket to fly into the air in a ""domino"" effect. The momentum starts with a mouse inside a hamster-wheel that, when rotated, will cause a boot attached to the wheel to flick a switch. The swith will power up an electric saw that will cut through a clip that is holding the string of a cocked bow. When the clip is cut, the bow will release the arrow to burst a balloon in front of it that is holding up a kettle-weight. When the balloon bursts, the weight will fall onto the left side of a see-saw, projecting the toy rocket, on the right-hand side of the see-saw, into the air.  ";126; momentum ;1
35; dysfunctional ; A helium balloon holding up a weight. A toy rocket aimed at the bottom of a shelf with a cocked crossbow.  The crossbow is aimed at a mouse on an exercise wheel.  An electric carving knife plugged into the electrical socket, and hangs from a nail. ;46;  ;0
36; dysfunctional ; I see an arrangement of various objects including a balloon with a weight tied to it, a bow and arrow and a hamster wheel above a knife attached to a plug socket. ;32;  ;0
37; dysfunctional ; 1    Left side i see a balloon held up with a weight and a ribbon on it_x000D_ _x000D_ 2.   Next one along looks like a rocket_x000D_ _x000D_ 3.   The one up from the rocket, looks like a bow and arrow rested on a stand _x000D_ _x000D_ 4.   The one up from the bow and arrow looks like a mouse running around in a ball, which is going along the floor on a wheel _x000D_ _x000D_ 5.   The one at the far right, looks like a chainsaw plugged in and hanging on a hook ;93;  ;0
38; functional ; On the left I can see a mechanical contraption which has been made out of different objects such as a bow and arrow, a wheel, wires and a chainsaw. On the right is a balloon which is attached to a weight, below this is a rocket balanced on top of a piece of wood. ;54;  ;0
39; dysfunctional ; I see something that looks like  medieval manuscript's depiction of a rube goldberg machine, but without actually being functional.  It has a balloon with a weight, a crossbow, a hamster wheel, and an iron plugged ito a socket ;38;  ;0
40; separate_parts ; These are a collection of small drawings. I'd think they were computer generated rather than hand drawn by a human but I'm not entirely sure why I think this. The small drawings are of various items, some simple such as a wheel and some more complicated such as what looks like a chainsaw.  ;53;  ;0
41; separate_parts ; I see nine objects that appear to be randomly distributed.  They are all in black and white and are fairly simple drawings as opposed to heavy on details. They are not drawn to scale and pretty much are small drawings. The objects are as follows: a weight on a rope, a wheel, a boot, a balance, a rocket, a rodent of some sort, a floating balloon attached to a string/rope and two abstract images, one that looks like a crossbow and the other looks like a chainsaw. They are both made up of other objects. ;95;  ;0
42; functional ; A detailed, complex contraption combination a crossbow, a wheeled base, and a wiring system with separate drawings of a balloon and a rocket. ;23;  ;0
43; functional ; A mouse on a wheel that when pushed around makes the boot flick  light switch. When this happens, the electricity being switched on causes the chain saw to work breaking the catapault that releases an arrow of sorts that bursts a balloon which drops to a platform as a weight is added and this propels a rocket upwards. ;58;  ;0
44; separate_parts ;" What we see here, in this drawing, is a series of inventions. The wheel being the most important of all, in the drawing it appears to be a bycycle wheel.  Other significant inventions are; a balloon, attached to some string to stop it floating away, a seesaw, from the side, just a plank, with a circular piece of wood in the centre, probably a log, one boot, a rocket, possibly a missile, a crossbow which seems to be mounted on a table, and a chainsaw which has bee plugged in to the wall socket and is hanging by a chain from a nail hammered into the wall.  The strangest addition to this drawing is the appearence of a little white mouse in the bottom right. ";125;  ;0
45; separate_parts ; Ballon,  rat,    orange slice,   shoe,   rockect ship,  bow and arrow,  hack saw ;12;  ;0
46; separate_parts ; I see a number of different objects and feel you could merge them to create different catapults to create a chain of events to happen. ;25;  ;0
47; functional ; I see a chain-reaction sort of machine. The goal is to launch a toy rocket by way of having a mouse run in a wheel, which turns a boot that flips a switch that starts a chainsaw, which cuts a cord that fires a crossbow that shoots an arrow that pierces a balloon that - once pierced - trops a weight onto a lever that will launch the toy rocket into the air. ;73;  ;0
48; dysfunctional ; I see a balloon tied to a weight, a bow and arrow with some sort of string attachment and a rocket underneath, a mouse in a wheel and a chainsaw attached to a nail on the wall. The whole thing seems to be some kind of elaborate system, maybe it is a trap. ;53;  ;0
49; dysfunctional ; I see a number of mechanical and electrical contraptions that can probably be linked and triggered to achieve some sort of outcome. ;22;  ;0
50; separate_parts ; I see a bunch of absolutely random items. it looks like all the random items that don't really relate to one another like a boot and mouse. A wheel and a balloon. It makes no sense ;36;  ;0
51; separate_parts ;" Top-center: a balloon on a string tied._x000D_ Right above: a crossbow and further off to the right, a handheld saw with a lengthy, curly power cord and a hanging down plug._x000D_ Middle-left: a rounded wheel (appears to be a wagon or citrus-slice wheel)._x000D_ To the right, a low flat board is mounted on one small wheel_x000D_ Bottom-left: a hanging punching bag; a small ankle boot is next to it, on the right._x000D_ Bottom-center: a small rocket in an upright position._x000D_ Bottom-right: a little mouse ";84;  ;0
52; separate_parts ; It looks like the parts of some sort of Heath Robinson contraption rather than a real machine. Weights lift a boot which kicks a see-saw  which somehow triggers  an electric carving knife to kill a mouse, - a bit like the old board game 'mouse trap' it wouldn't really work ;50;  ;0
53; separate_parts ;" I can see drawing of different tools that most has to do with engineering; a wheel, a rocket, a baloon, a boot, a mouse. ";24;  ;0
54; separate_parts ; I see a bow and arrow, on the left side next to it there is an inflated balloon, and on the right side next to it there is  a saw that seems attached to what I think is a rope with a padlock. Then on the bottom left side I see a wheel, see-saw and bottom left to right is boot, rocket and mouse. I'm not sure about the item next to the boot. ;74;  ;0
55; dysfunctional ; I see, on the left, a balloon tied to a weight, seemingly holding the weight up in the air, although the weight looks far too heavy for this to be the case, so a revised interpretation would be that it's a helium-filled balloon attached to a weight that's on the floor. To the right of this, there is a small rocket under a platform or shelf possibly supporting a crossbow with an arrow in it. A little higher up and to the right of that, there's a rodent in a hamster wheel over a board on a small wheel and farther to the right and a bit lower, level with the crossbow, there's a nail, hanging from which there is a chainsaw or electric knife with a twisted cord attached to a small box of some kind, which is the lowest object on the picture. All is in black and grey on a white background, and the pictures are more like diagrams than drawings - simplified and mostly outlines. The lower part of the rocket fins seems to be missing. The most confusing part is the item above the rocket, from which emerges the crossbow or bow and arrow. The light source is contradictory going by the shadows on the balloon and weight. The weight is the darkest item. There is a bow tied round the bottom of the balloon. ;230;  ;0
56; separate_parts ; many objects, balloon, rocket, mouse, shoe, seesaw, wheel, bow, chainsaw, weight ;11;  ;0
57; dysfunctional ;" I see a number of items.

";122;  ;0
58; functional ; The drawing shows a complex machine.  The machine moves from left to right, with a hamster in a wheel (with a boot attached). When the hamster runs. the boot kicks a switch which has an electric carving knife plugged into it, switching on the knife.  The knife cuts a cord that is tied to the bowstring of a bow, shooting the sharp arrow at a balloon.  The balloon pops, meaning that the weight tied to the balloon is release, it drops onto the left hand side of a board balanced on a circle.  As the weight hits the board, a rocket on the right side of the board is propelled upwards. ;111; position, velocity, force, torque, acceleration ;5
59; dysfunctional ; I can see a balloon with a weight tied onto it, hanging below. I can see a chain saw pinned into a wall with its wire attached to a plug. I can see a hamster running in a wheel with a foot on a platform with a wheel, balancing on it. I can see a rocket pointing upwards towards a bow and arrow attached to some kind of platform. ;69;  ;0

62; functional ; I see a diagram of an invention which uses a series of events to achieve an end goal. The hamster turning the wheel will make the boot kick the switch. This will activate the knife, which will cut the rope and cause the bow to be fired. The balloon will pop, the weight will drop and the rocket will be fired upwards.  ;62;  ;0
