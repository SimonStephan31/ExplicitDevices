m8VkSAsPXGpd;1;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;incorrect;I chose the whisk because it will cause an acceleration to the machine and get the longer part in front of the blocked out part to move or work faster. A knife is useless in this situation because this machine is about getting it to speed up and a whisk will rotate and get the machine to speed up not a knife. ;correct;Because the mouse will run inside the wheel causing it to ramp up and the kicker (boot like object) will hit the switch and charge up the wire. I did not use the wheel reflector because it will not be able to cause the wheel to move at all. ;incorrect;Because when the section cup is launched it will be able to attacth onto the balloon and suck out the air out of it, I did not choose the star because it might cause the balloon to pop. ;correct;i chose the weight because it looks like it weighs less than the kid and also this seems a bit dangerous and I think this is just an experiment and the best thing to use is a none living object so the kid does not get hurt. ;3: A toy car.;correct;31;2: female;I was confused at the memory test because we had to choose an object that was not part of the experiment and I did not see a toy car(unless this was the spaceship) or a crossbow (unless these were the suction cup or star).

The end looks like a bow and arrow so the star looks more like the arrow than the suction cup so that's my reasoning. ;incorrect;I think that the kid would be more suitable because the child already looks like they are holding the string of the balloon. ;3: A toy car.;correct;38;2: female;no errors :);17.10.2025 08:40

c5P1kNssrBds;1;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;incorrect;The part the whisk would be attached to appears to be motorised, thus a whisk would seem more suitable. Equally it appears that as the whisk turns it would tighten the strings causing the bow and arrow to be pulled back and ready to fire. ;correct;The mouse can move inside the wheel to turn it around and therefore begin the sequence of events.;correct;The star should hit the balloon, popping it and then dropping the weight. This is more suitable to allow the chain reaction of events to continue.;correct;The kid is probably too heavy to be lifted up by a balloon.

A whisk won't achieve this, but a knife will.;correct;It looks as though the wheel needs to power the whole setup, which can be generated by the mouse running.  I'm not sure how a wheel reflector would do this.;correct;This component needs to pop the balloon in order for the weight to fall - a suction cup won't achieve this, but a pointed star will.;correct;Either one of these could probably work once the balloon pops but the weight is smaller and less likely to obstruct the rocket, and will have a controlled descent whereas the kid might be all over the place.;3: A toy car.;correct;44;1: male;NA;17.10.2025 11:58

LZ0FqTqH7xVh;1;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;functional;incorrect;A whisk is a tool that is made of several small wires that can rotate or move inorder to mix things up. The shape and structure of a whisk makes it best fit for a machine that requires spinning its parts, whereas a knife is built to cut and not rotate or mix because e of its sharp edge hence it is unsustainable. ;incorrect;I choose the wheel reflector because it is more appropriate for this part since it is built to rotate smoothly around a wheel or an area where reflection is needed. Whereas,a mouse is a living thing and not a manufactured object and so does not have the function that will allow for its rotation. ;incorrect;A suction cup is mechanically designed to attach to smooth or flat surfaces making it best fit for machines that requires a temporary grip for objects.On the hand a star shaped bow will not hold nor support a machine. ;correct;A weight is a solid object that can provide balance within a machine, whereas a kid is a living thing not a component. ;3: A toy car.;correct;45;1: male;no errors ;17.10.2025 12:02

In this case, I assume the knife will cut the string which holds tension, so that the component at the tip can become a projectile.;correct;The mouse creates the energy needed to spin the wheel by running on it and causing it to endlessly spin. This makes sense because the next section of the design seems to be a string which supposedly will tighten as the mouse cycles on the wheel.;incorrect;The suction cup makes more sense as a suitable component. I assume once the suction cup is released and becomes a projectile, it is designed to stick onto the desired target.;correct;The weight is considerably smaller in size compared to the kid's.

I can’t understand the purpose of a wheel reflector in this instance ;incorrect;I feel the suction cup is more appropriate for this part as when it is fired it can stick onto something which is the appropriate use of this object ;incorrect;I feel the kid is the more appropriate component for this part as kids like to hold balloons ;3: A toy car.;correct;37;2: female;No;17.10.2025 12:16

s4FLrUeTD86M;2;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;separate_parts;incorrect;This object depicts an electrical appliance plugged into the wall with the end hidden. It would make logical sense that this would be a whisk and not a knife as generally there would be no purpose in having an electric powered knife.;incorrect;The uncovered part of the image depicts a wheel with the blue hidden box covering the spokes. It therefore makes sense that the covered item here is a wheel reflector and not a mouse.;incorrect;It makes sense here that the arrow tip of the crossbow, which is hidden by the blue box, is formed of a suction cup. This is due to the fact that when shooting a crossbow with a suction cup on the end it will stick to the surface you are firing at whereas a star would just fall off.;incorrect;This could easily be either of the items here as the weight could be being used to weigh down the balloon or the child could be holding the baloon. However, in this case the hidden object is the child as the box is too big to be just a weight.;3: A toy car.;correct;27;1: male;NA;17.10.2025 12:47

Whereas the knife looks like the right balance to the handle.;incorrect;The wheel reflector would work better to put on the spokes of the wheel, to reflect light to keep the rider safe. It's the wrong kind of wheel for a mouse to run in.;incorrect;It would make it able to stick to certain surfaces you fire it at. While the star one, would just bounce off of things or hurt people.;correct;The weight can keep the balloon at a certain height at all times, while a kid could only hold it for so long before letting go, and then the balloon would fly off.;3: A toy car.;correct;35;2: female;NA;17.10.2025 12:47
DGxyF9C2hEdD;2;1: I confirm;1: I will take it seriously;separate_parts;incorrect;I think a whisk is much more suitable for this sort of machine. Electric whisks are used in a number of baking and cooking activities, whereas that style of electric knife is less common (mostly for carving things). As a result I, and people I know, use an electric whisk but don't even own an electric knife, so I think the whisk has more uses and is more suitable. ;incorrect;This looks more like the wheel on a bicycle, with the extra ring around it and spokes coming off, which is why the reflector makes more sense. A mousewheel usually wouldn't have the spokes for example, or at least not as prominent ;incorrect;The suction cup would make sense as some toys use that on the end. If it were a weapon the star would be reaosnable (too likely to hurt someone if that isn't for a weapon, so my assumption is that the star is for a weapon), but if that were the case then it would likely be a point as the extra sides/edges of the star are unnecessary, and so the suction cup is more intuitve. ;incorrect;Generally I'd associate children with balloons more than weights. Although balloons can be weighted down, I'd expect they generally get more use as being something children hold on to. ;3: A toy car.;correct;28;1: male;NA;17.10.2025 12:47
